KCDC (KEMS Control and Data Collection) intends to make available a modular software frame to control a KEMS instrument in which users can implement their own hardware. It is designed modular to ease the addition of new functions and instruments, just by modifying existing modules (loops).

Target users:
All people developing software for a KEMS instrument.

The code is written with LabVIEW 2019.0 f2 32bit.

The labview code of KCDC is distributed under the form of a labview project zipped build.

You will need LabVIEW 2019 or higher to open and run the as distributed code.

If you wish to share your modifications and the implementation of your instruments, you are
welcome to open a new branch in the GitHUB.

The code is functional with Software simulation activated for all instruments.

Code version: 1.0
